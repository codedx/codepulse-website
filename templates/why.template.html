	A continuous challenge facing penetration testers is ensuring adequate 
	coverage of a target application. A purely black box perspective makes 
	it almost impossible to accurately identify how much of the attack surface
	was tested for penetration during assessment. Glass box testing techniques
	significantly improve the insight that penetration testers have into the
	coverage and makeup of the applications they are targeting.
	</p>

	<p>
	Code Pulse is a glass box tool that provides insight into the real-time
	code coverage of black box testing activities. Code Pulse automatically
	detects the coverage information while the tests are being conducted and
	will even make it possible to understand the overlaps and boundaries of
	the different tools coverage.
	</p>

	<p>
	Code Pulse presents the coverage information in a visual form to make it
	easy to understand at-a-glance which parts of an application have been
	covered, and how much. The real-time coverage feedback makes it easy to
	adjust testing activity based on the observed coverage. In addition, for
	testing activities relying on multiple techniques (a variety of dynamic
	analysis tools for instance) it's fairly easy to split up the recorded
	activity to understand which code was covered by each tool independently
	or alternatively to view where the coverage overlaps between multiple tools.
